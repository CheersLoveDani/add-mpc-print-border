# ðŸŽ‰ Input History Feature Implemented!

## âœ… What's New

Your MPC Print Bleed Border Tool now includes **input history functionality**! This means you can use your keyboard arrows to navigate through previously entered folder paths.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### **First Time Usage:**
1. Run the program: `pipenv run python add_mpc_bleed.py`
2. Enter your input and output folder paths normally
3. The paths are automatically saved to your history

### **Subsequent Usage:**
1. Run the program again
2. When prompted for folder paths, press **â†‘** (up arrow) to recall your last input
3. Use **â†‘/â†“** arrows to navigate through your recent folder paths
4. Press **Enter** to use the selected path, or type a new one

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Dependencies Added:**
- `pyreadline3>=3.4.1` for Windows readline support
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Linux/Mac too)

### **Features:**
- **Persistent History**: Saved in `~/.mpc_bleed_history` file
- **100 Entry Limit**: Keeps the most recent 100 folder paths
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works even if readline isn't available
- **Automatic Cleanup**: History is saved when program exits

### **Visual Indicators:**
- âœ… **"Input history enabled"** message when readline is working
- ðŸ’¡ **Tip message** showing users how to use arrow keys
- **No changes to workflow** - just enhanced convenience

## ðŸ“‚ Files Modified

- `add_mpc_bleed.py` - Added InputHistory class and readline support
- `requirements.txt` - Added pyreadline3 dependency
- `Pipfile` - Added pyreadline3 for pipenv users
- `.gitignore` - Added history file to ignore list

## ðŸ§ª Testing Status

- âœ… All existing tests still pass
- âœ… Input history functionality working
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… Graceful error handling

## ðŸ’¡ User Experience

Now when you run the tool multiple times, you can:
- **Press â†‘** to instantly get your last input folder
- **Press â†‘ again** to get the folder before that
- **Save time** by not retyping long folder paths
- **Navigate quickly** through your recent projects

This is especially useful when processing multiple batches of cards from the same folders! ðŸŽ´
